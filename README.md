# Rush-JS-JQuery

During my intensive training course at "Coding Academy" (Epitech-Paris, France), I had to realize several "rush" projects as a way to assess my knowledge at the end of each module.

Here are 2 projects from a JavaScript/JQuery rush (3 days). Initially, each student had to choose between 2 subjects:
- the creation of a game in JQuery which is a clone of the [game 2048(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game))], a single-player sliding block puzzle game.
- the creation of a [mind-map(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)].
I decided to carry out both projects within the three allocated days. I succeeded :)
